# Song-to-Images
This program gets the individual words in song lyrics and downloads an image from a google search for each unique one. The lyrics can be loaded from input or a file, and there are different options for download behavior. There is also an example. lyrics.txt contains the lyrics for the song Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears. The folder Example contains the images downloaded from said loaded file. The download option used for this selected a random image from the top ten results. I am not responsible for any actions Google may take against you for excessive scraping (temporary block, ban, etc.)
