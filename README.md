# Song-to-Images
This program gets the individual words in song lyrics and downloads an image from a google search for each unique one. The lyrics can be loaded from input or a file, and there are different options for download behavior. I am not responsible for any actions Google may take against you for excessive scraping (temporary block, ban, etc.)
